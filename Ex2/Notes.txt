Notes:

1. As opposed to exercise 1, in here when reaching the end of the moves file, the FilePlayer generates an illegal
move and loses.

2. If a joker change is illegal, but before getting that change a player captured his opponent's flag, that player
will lose the game due to the illegal change (flag status is checked at the end of the move).

3. A legal move is defined as a move of a piece owned by the same player who called the move, and is not moving to a
location that holds another piece by the same player. Also a move must be one spot in one of the following directions:
up/down/left/right, as long as the destination is within the boundries of the board. note that a move which not moves
is illegal (such as 5 5 5 5).
